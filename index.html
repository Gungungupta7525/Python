  <h1> Introduction</h1>  
  <h2>What is Python?</h2>
  <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
<br><br>
It is used for:
<ol>
    <li>
    web development (server-side)</li>
   <li> software development</li>
    <li>mathematics</li>
    <li>system scripting.
    </li>
    </ol>
</p>
<h2>What can Python do?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
    Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
  <li> Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li> 
   <li> Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
   <li> Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
   <li> Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Why Python?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).</li>
<li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
<li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li>
<li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
<li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way</li></ul>
<h2>Python Syntax compared to other programming languages</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.</li>
     <li>Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.</li>
      <li>Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose</li>
